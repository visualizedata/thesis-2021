      "subtitle": "Visualizing water quality testing in the River Basins of Alabama",
      "description": "Alabama’s climate and geographic history makes it one of the most ecologically diverse states in the United States. At the same time, a history of industrial accidents and abuse has led to disasters that have harmed everything from ponds to populations of cities to coastlines. Since 1998 stricter water monitoring policies have been mandated in an attempt to control the human and environmental harm caused by pollutants. This project seeks to analyze the progress that has been made during the past 20 years of water quality testing. Data from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) is used to visualize the scope of water contamination in each river basin by size, cause, and source.",

      "subtitle": "An exploration of Forest Kindergartens and nature-based learning",
      "description": "Outdoor education is not a new concept. It’s been used around the world in various forms for decades and has been increasingly popular in the United States in the form of Forest Kindergartens. Forest Kindergarten is a pedagogy rooted in the idea of free-flow learning, nature immersion, and child-led curriculums. Since the introduction of these programs in the United States, those involved have praised the educational, developmental, and physical benefits, with many academic sources conducting research to back them up. Even still, those just learning about the concept have a variety of questions about its efficacy, many that seem to be driven by a sense of bewilderment that a program so different from the traditional structure could possibly lend the same results. This project aims to show how these programs operate in relation to the traditional kindergarten system and how the current public education structure can begin to think about adopting and benefiting from the concepts applied in the nature-based programs. The project itself is broken down into four sections: Origins, Structure, Outcomes, and Implementation. The end goal is to provide a collection of information about nature-based kindergarten programs to enable audiences in urban, rural, wealthy, and struggling areas to equally learn and benefit from educational developments happening around the country and the world.",

      "subtitle": "The Need to Reconsider Negative Emissions Technologies",
      "description": "In 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report declaring a 1.5°C limit i.e. limiting global temperatures to below 1.5° C above pre-industrial levels. This figure is important, because once that threshold is crossed, not only will there be grave consequences for society, but weather systems will react in unpredictable ways. Given the fact that there are no immediate plans to systematically cut C02 emissions, we have double the work cut out for us. This paper attempts to outline the main limits to and unknowns of scaling up one specific Negative Emissions Technology (NET) referred to as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). The final section of the paper will provide an overview of a number of strategies that are being proposed by well-recognized environmental justice organizations and must be considered in order to create lasting systemic change.",

      "title": "Generating Book Cover Art Using Emotion Detected Labels in Classical Literature",
      "subtitle": "Deriving patterns from the emotional landcape of literary texts between 1800-1920",
      "description": "This thesis uses machine learning emotion classification processes in order to create emotionally representative book covers. Both proprietary and hand crafted APIs are used to analyze emotions found in the corpuses of the 25 high ranking books from Project Gutenberg. Multiple emotion recognition models are evaluated for accuracy and value within the literary space. The machine learning models are then compared to human evaluations of emotions, based on existing psychoanalytic research. Results indicate that machine learning models are able to adequately predict the emotions in novels and generate supporting book cover art. \n\nThe final outcome of this project will be printable manuscripts with custom generated covers. The visualizations are built using D3js and data storytelling techniques. The charts will be imported into InDesign for final production and typesetting. In order to avoid copyright issues, all books used are in the public domain, with original publish dates between 1800 and 1925. The physical book will contain the text of the original author, as well as accompanying text and diagrams provided from this project.",

      "subtitle": "How COVID-19 has changed the video game industry",
      "description": "The video game industry has undergone a series of changes as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Stress on the supply chains of hardware and software have forced companies to adjust to new working environments within short periods of time. At the same time, people have turned more and more towards games as a form of leisure, entertainment, and human connection. We analyze several economic and human studies data sets collected during the past 2 years in order to visualize the supply, demand, and popularity of games during the pandemic. Our results suggest that despite turbulence in the supply chain, game companies have managed to adequately shift their business models to allow for tremendous growth as other industries have struggled. /nIn this project, the visualizations present how regular production process, total consumer spending, user behavior and gaming community network were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. As we expected, the video game industry has demonstrated with data that it is unshakable in people's minds and will go farther in the future.",

      "description": "Current specimens being displayed at museums are attempts and efforts of mankind's wisdom in creating traces of their presence, representing their appearance, and preserving the disappearance of species, but there are user-experience gaps between the stories museums provide and what people further desire, between the digital interface and the physical settings, and between the developed areas and the developing ones. This project creates a low-cost data-driven framework that takes full advantage of the scalability of digital media and perceivability of real-world objects to reactivate exhibits and enhance in-person engagement in museums. With the future goal of being compatible with datasets of other species, providing API for further in-depth development, this project will first focus on avian species in the National Wetland Museum of China to display specimens through a digital-physical fusion strategy.",

      "description": "This thesis visualizes AI-related patent filings by geographic region in the United States between 2000-2020 to better understand the landscape and asymmetries existing throughout regional clusters.\n\n Inventions are signals from the future, as much as they are from the past. They provide us with a barometer for measuring the patterns of economic activity, policy direction, and competitive moat-building by international companies and governments across the world. These visual explorations will serve to connect policy makers, investors, entrepreneurs and academic commercialization offices with opportunities to make better decisions, bring ideas to market, and grow the economy sustainably within the United States.\n\n Without mentioning the communities affected by the dispersion of AI technologies would be a great disservice. There is an even greater need for accelerating education within underrepresented communities; where patents are not being filed. I argue for an increasing need to create an international definition for AI-assisted inventions, and for the creation of an intellectual property commons, which is funded by corporate profitability of AI technologies in order to address the shorter-term inequalities which will result from the displacement due to skills-bias, and other labor demand asymmetries. Redistribution from gains within the short-term will help buffer the problems created by these technologies. I’m optimistic that the advances created by AI as seen through this patent landscape will be a net positive for more developed countries, and there needs to be a framework established to help developing nations and underrepresented communities to benefit in the long-term as well.",

      "title": "Mapping the Literary Geography of Sonagi",
      "subtitle": "Picturing a Fictional Space: A spatial and data-based way to explore the text of literature",
      "description": "Sonagi is a Korean word that means “rain shower”. It is also the title of a short story by the author Hwang Sun Won, one of the most accomplished writers of short fiction in modern Korea literature. The story which has a simple plot of “a boy in the countryside meets a girl from the city” is one of the most well-known short stories of Hwang and has also become an inspiration for animation, film, stage musicals and so on. Through these retold interpretations of Sonagi, the idyllic and natural setting that two young protagonists explore on foot has been visually recreated. This thesis project aims to identify the literary geography of Sonagi and construct a literary map of the story inthe standpoint of data collection and visualization. By doing so, this project provides a spatial and data-based way to explore the text of Sonagi, which may not be obvious when reading text only. Through this endeavor, the project poses and answers a few questions as well: How do readers picture a fictional space when reading literature?; Does uncertainty in text allow room for creative interpretation for the audience?; What role can visualization play in understanding literature? From the original text which is accompanied by English translation, expressions that indicate locations of action, locations recognized by the characters, or locations referred to in the story are collected and used to visualize the map of the fictional space in the story. Some examples of such can be Creek, Stepping Stones, Buckwheat Fields and Mountain.",

      "description": "Since March 2020, when the COVID-19 lockdown began, the restaurant industry, employing hundreds of thousands, attracting millions of visitors who spend around $46 billion annually, suffered a dual burden of having lost the customer flow on which it depended on for survival but also now being termed as “essential”. The food service industry has had to radically shift how it operated, with a larger focus on deliveries and now outdoor dining. There is a need to understand and document the changes in the hospitality industry because they are fundamentally changing their own streets and neighbourhoods, and in doing so transforming the city as a whole. In the following sections, public data on restaurants, labour, federal support, and data collected and ‘scrapped’ from the news sites will be used to chart out and map the significance of the industry to New York City, the damage done by the pandemic, and finally, the attempted recovery efforts.",

      "description": "Many of the women that have contributed to the scientific field have been lost to history either from their male colleagues taking credit for their work or people deeming their work not important. Women such as Rosalind Franklin, Lisa Meitner, Emilie du Châtelet and many more were lost to history, their contributions to science and technology overlooked. These women were affected by the phenomenon called The Matilda Effect. The Matilda Effect is a bias against acknowledging the achievements of those women scientists whose work is attributed to their male colleagues. This thesis will explore and visualize the connection between The Matilda Effect and women in science today by answering questions such as who the women effected by The Matilda Effect are, what the lasting effects on the world today are, and how female role models can increase the number of girls entering into STEM fields.",

      "description": "This project analyzes two remarkabley different chess matches played between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi: the game two classic from the 1974 Candidates Final in Moscow, and the entire, bizarre 1978 World Chess Championship in the Philippines. The research qualifies and quantifies the relationship between chess, pattern recognition, and the pitfalls therein with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics, and cognitive psychology. Additionally, we will see that a grandmaster's heightened sensitivity to pattern recognition, time and ulterior motives carry broad implications for the way we extract meaning from information in our own high-pressure environment today. The visualizations that accompany the game analysis are designed to help readers see chess in the same way that a grandmaster does, and in so doing, help them to identify similarities between a grandmaster’s state of mind and their own. Are we under the same kind of pressure as a chess genius? Is this reasonable? What ways do chess prodigies respond to this pressure and what are the possible outcomes?",
