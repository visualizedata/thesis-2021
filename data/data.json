      "subtitle": "An exploration of Forest Kindergartens and nature-based learning",
      "description": "Outdoor education is not a new concept. It’s been used around the world in various forms for decades and has been increasingly popular in the United States in the form of Forest Kindergartens. Forest Kindergarten is a pedagogy rooted in the idea of free-flow learning, nature immersion, and child-led curriculums. Since the introduction of these programs in the United States, those involved have praised the educational, developmental, and physical benefits, with many academic sources conducting research to back them up. Even still, those just learning about the concept have a variety of questions about its efficacy, many that seem to be driven by a sense of bewilderment that a program so different from the traditional structure could possibly lend the same results. This project aims to show how these programs operate in relation to the traditional kindergarten system and how the current public education structure can begin to think about adopting and benefiting from the concepts applied in the nature-based programs. The project itself is broken down into four sections: Origins, Structure, Outcomes, and Implementation. The end goal is to provide a collection of information about nature-based kindergarten programs to enable audiences in urban, rural, wealthy, and struggling areas to equally learn and benefit from educational developments happening around the country and the world.",

      "description": "In 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report declaring a 1.5°C limit i.e. limiting global temperatures to below 1.5° C above pre-industrial levels. This figure is important, because once that threshold is crossed, not only will there be grave consequences for society, but weather systems will react in unpredictable ways. Given the fact that there are no immediate plans to systematically cut C02 emissions, we have double the work cut out for us. This paper attempts to outline the main limits to and unknowns of scaling up one specific Negative Emissions Technology (NET) referred to as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). The final section of the paper will provide an overview of a number of strategies that are being proposed by well-recognized environmental justice organizations and must be considered in order to create lasting systemic change.",

      "description": "Current specimens being displayed at museums are attempts and efforts of mankind's wisdom in creating traces of their presence, representing their appearance, and preserving the disappearance of species, but there are user-experience gaps between the stories museums provide and what people further desire, between the digital interface and the physical settings, and between the developed areas and the developing ones. This project creates a low-cost data-driven framework that takes full advantage of the scalability of digital media and perceivability of real-world objects to reactivate exhibits and enhance in-person engagement in museums. With the future goal of being compatible with datasets of other species, providing API for further in-depth development, this project will first focus on avian species in the National Wetland Museum of China to display specimens through a digital-physical fusion strategy.",

The author of this paper explores trends in written English and how new digital mediums have changed the way people read.

      "subtitle": "Mapping AI Patent Landscapes",
      "description": "This thesis visualizes AI-related patent filings by geographic region in the United States between 2000-2020 to better understand the landscape and asymmetries existing throughout regional clusters.\n Inventions are signals from the future, as much as they are from the past. They provide us with a barometer for measuring the patterns of economic activity, policy direction, and competitive moat-building by international companies and governments across the world. These visual explorations will serve to connect policy makers, investors, entrepreneurs and academic commercialization offices with opportunities to make better decisions, bring ideas to market, and grow the economy sustainably within the United States.\n Without mentioning the communities affected by the dispersion of AI technologies would be a great disservice. There is an even greater need for accelerating education within underrepresented communities; where patents are not being filed. I argue for an increasing need to create an international definition for AI-assisted inventions, and for the creation of an intellectual property commons, which is funded by corporate profitability of AI technologies in order to address the shorter-term inequalities which will result from the displacement due to skills-bias, and other labor demand asymmetries. Redistribution from gains within the short-term will help buffer the problems created by these technologies. I’m optimistic that the advances created by AI as seen through this patent landscape will be a net positive for more developed countries, and there needs to be a framework established to help developing nations and underrepresented communities to benefit in the long-term as well.",

      "subtitle": "Picturing a Fictional Space: A spatial and data-based way to explore the text of literature",
      "description": "Sonagi is a Korean word that means “rain shower”. It is also the title of a short story by the author Hwang Sun Won, one of the most accomplished writers of short fiction in modern Korea literature. The story which has a simple plot of “a boy in the countryside meets a girl from the city” is one of the most well-known short stories of Hwang and has also become an inspiration for animation, film, stage musicals and so on. Through these retold interpretations of Sonagi, the idyllic and natural setting that two young protagonists explore on foot has been visually recreated. This thesis project aims to identify the literary geography of Sonagi and construct a literary map of the story inthe standpoint of data collection and visualization. By doing so, this project provides a spatial and data-based way to explore the text of Sonagi, which may not be obvious when reading text only. Through this endeavor, the project poses and answers a few questions as well: How do readers picture a fictional space when reading literature?; Does uncertainty in text allow room for creative interpretation for the audience?; What role can visualization play in understanding literature? From the original text which is accompanied by English translation, expressions that indicate locations of action, locations recognized by the characters, or locations referred to in the story are collected and used to visualize the map of the fictional space in the story. Some examples of such can be Creek, Stepping Stones, Buckwheat Fields and Mountain.",

      "description": "Since March 2020, when the COVID-19 lockdown began, the restaurant industry, employing hundreds of thousands, attracting millions of visitors who spend around $46 billion annually, suffered a dual burden of having lost the customer flow on which it depended on for survival but also now being termed as “essential”. The food service industry has had to radically shift how it operated, with a larger focus on deliveries and now outdoor dining. There is a need to understand and document the changes in the hospitality industry because they are fundamentally changing their own streets and neighbourhoods, and in doing so transforming the city as a whole. In the following sections, public data on restaurants, labour, federal support, and data collected and ‘scrapped’ from the news sites will be used to chart out and map the significance of the industry to New York City, the damage done by the pandemic, and finally, the attempted recovery efforts.",
